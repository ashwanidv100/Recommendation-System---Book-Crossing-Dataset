# Recommendation-System---Book-Crossing-Dataset
Building Recommendation System based on user-based and item-based collaborative filtering approaches.

## Book-Crossing
The Book-Crossing dataset is a collection of user ratings of books. It comes with both explicit ratings (1-10 stars) and implicit ratings (user interacted with the book). The data was compiled by Cai-Nicolas Ziegler of IIF and can be found [here](http://www2.informatik.uni-freiburg.de/~cziegler/BX/).

More information about the data is available in Ziegler et al.:
